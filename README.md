# CS760 Final Project
Stewart Kerr, Andrew Maule, Noah Stafford, Harry Zhou, Nathaniel Schleif

Task: The main task to be addressed by this project is to discover the network of interactions between genes. We will do this by analyzing mRNA expression data derived from RNA-seq experiments. Specifically, we will use a dynamic bayesian network to model the gene interactions.
